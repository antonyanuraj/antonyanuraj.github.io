    - Create an account on [Github](https://github.com), you will need to provide an email address, username and password.

3) Resume  

    - The Resume has to be in Markdown format. If you are not familiar with syntax of Markdown or need a refresher, please refer to [Markdown Tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

__By using your username as the repository name, it lets Github know that this repository will be using Github Pages.__
